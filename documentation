Logic and introduction:
  we have created a weight conversion calculator. 
  This is totally web based application which will  run inside a web browser.
  A user can input value which is to be converted from required

 and body of the project.hyperlinks have been used in head part of the project.In html ,import types and labels of conversions,
 counts ,ids of converstions are created which are further called in javascript. 9 weight converters are created using functions 
 which are called by ids where reqired formulae of conversion are used.

 Body background colour is linear gradient(90 deg.)
